"""Data pass: verify asset bytes against what the metadata declares.

The metadata pass checks that assets *declare* the required fields — an
``href``, a media ``type``, a positive ``file:size``, a well-formed
``file:checksum`` (``PTL-AST-001..004``). None of that opens the asset, so a
catalog can declare a checksum, size, format, or extent that its actual bytes
contradict and still pass. core.md makes several of these a hard MUST:
``file:checksum``/``file:size`` "MUST be regenerated at publish time … so they
always match what is in the bucket", and each format carries a required media
type.

This opt-in pass reads the bytes — local files and remote ``https`` assets — and
reports where they diverge from the claim. Like the structural and schema passes
it is off by default (CLI ``--data``; ``validate(..., data=True)``), reaches the
network, and downgrades to a single WARNING when it cannot run.

The heavy geospatial dependencies (``pyarrow``, ``rasterio``, ``rio-cogeo``,
``pyproj``, ``pmtiles``) live behind the ``reis[data]`` extra and are imported
lazily by :func:`default_validator`, so the core package stays stdlib-only and a
catalog with no data pass installs nothing new.
