"""Source-provenance rules (spec: core.md, Source Provenance).

Official vs mirror is derived from a collection's providers: official when
the producer and host are the same organization, mirror when they differ.
When providers are malformed these rules stay silent — the provider rules
already report that, and provenance cannot be derived from broken input.
