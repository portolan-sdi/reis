"""Schema pass: Portolan profile validation, delegated to the published schema.

The metadata pass (:mod:`reis.rules`) checks Portolan requirements by hand over
raw JSON, deliberately stdlib-only, so it can emit precise per-rule findings with
fix hints. The Portolan STAC Profile publishes those same requirements as a
single machine-checkable JSON Schema — the spec calls it "the machine-checkable
core of the metadata pass". This pass applies that published schema directly to
every object, exactly as the profile's own ``check-portolan`` test does: an
authoritative oracle that catches any drift between reis's hand rules and the
canonical schema, and any requirement the hand rules do not yet cover.

Because it overlaps the hand rules by design, the pass is opt-in (CLI
``--schema``; ``validate(..., schema=True)``). When it runs, a defect may be
reported twice — once by a hand rule with a fix hint, once here with the schema's
own message; the second is the canonical verdict.

The validator is injectable so the pass can be exercised offline in tests. The
default implementation fetches the schema over the network (cached in-process)
from the URI the root catalog declares, falling back to the pinned v0.1 URI. A
validator that cannot run — the ``jsonschema`` package is absent, or the schema
is unreachable — downgrades to a single WARNING so the offline metadata findings
still surface.
